$ git clone https://github.com/trevorjones/jsonresume-theme-elegant

Visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to see the theme in action.

### Testing JSON changes
You can test your changes by updating `resume.json` file inside `node_modules/resume-schema/` folder. You might want to rerun `grunt exec:run_server` whenever you make any changes to `resume.json`

### Updating Styles
All the LESS files are organized under the folder `assets/less/`. Please go through the comments inside `theme.less` to find out which file to put your LESS changes. Grunt compiles `assets/less/theme.less` to `assets/css/theme.css` which is used eventually in the theme. 

**_Please Do not make any changes inside `assets/css/theme.css`_**

### Updating Javascript
All the javascript changes go into `index.js` which is responsible for rendering the theme.
