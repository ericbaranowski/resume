				Larry is a current client of Kulado Inc. I met Larry through a previous client referral and have been working with him for over three years. I have done various projects for him including a Salesforce integration and ongoing administration. Automated his Pension Fund reports, developed a secure virtual data room to share the reports while restricting the ability to share or download the reports. Larry speaks highly of me because I have provided him with excellent customer service, which includes taking his calls at 2am to wrap up projects or provide random tech support, business, or accounting advice for him. Larry continues to trust me with full, unmonitored access to everything in his business and personal life, including his business and personal credit cards and accounts, totalling in excess of half a million dollars.
